          About Me
        </h1>

        <p style={{ marginTop: 20, textAlign: "left", marginBottom: 80 }}>
          I am pursuing Mechanical Engineering as already told, however I am
          passionate in a range of stuff, ranging from academics to art.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I have been involved in programming for started and even
          created a number of API's for various projects using my skills. Not
          only this, I have even been working on a research paper on online
          gaming.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I have been involved in a number of Non-Tech activities as
          well, such as I was a part of the Organising Team of my colleges
          annual fest as a part of the Sponsorship Department, I really created
          long lasting relationships with the brands I interacted with during
          the same.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Coming to the real stuff, I love painting and dancing. Like these are
          for me the best utilization of time and believe me you wouldn't want
          to challenge me in any.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          PS - I love brownie-ice-cream and chalks ðŸ˜‹
